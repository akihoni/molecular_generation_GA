# Molecule Generator

A fragment-based molecular generation method used GA.

The method could preform multi-objective optimization.

`generate_frag_lib.py`: Decomposing the real molecules into fragments.

`prediction_model.py`: Training the odor prediction model.

`mol_generator_random.py`: Generating new molecules by choosing fragments randomly.

`mol_generator_ga.py`: Generating new molecules by GA.
